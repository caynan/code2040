code2040: API Challenge
========

This are my solutions to the CODE2040: API Challenge

How I Tackle This
-----------------
- Created a class for all the API communications, this could be used later to build other tools.
- Created a webpage that solves the problems using javascript on the client side (see gh-pages branch)
- Created a CLI using python, for making the use of the API more easy.

TODO
----
- [ ] Create AngularJS scripts
  - [ ] http request using `$http`
  - [ ] view modification
- [ ] Create Java Implementation
- [ ] Create tests for python implementation
- [ ] Create Blog post explaining steps to develop each interface
